    <h1>You've Landed in My Nest!</h1>
  <section id= "intro">
    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
       My name is Steph Lewis. I'm a 27-year-old descendant of Vikings that still has no idea what I want to be when I grow
       up. I wanted to work in the medical field when I entered my undergraduate program, and within two years ended up switching
       majors to Studio Art. I had initially wanted to work in 3-D Animation, but my post-graduate program was discontinued 
       following a series of Art School closures in 2018. Instead, I ended up working through an apprenticeship to become a
       certified Bench Jeweler. Following a horrible injury to my left hand which happened because of negligent <em>safety</em> policy, 
       I needed to reassess my future. So now, I'm enrolling in Flatiron School's Software Engineering Program with the hopes to land 
       a job as a Visual Artist for Lockheed Martin -- or something akin to that.

    <h3>Why's Your Name CrestLark?</h3>
    <p> In the online world, I've elected to go by Lark or CrestLark. I initially decided to use a pseudonym for privacy 
      while I was gaming. Eventually, I also adopted it when writing or posting artwork as well. I first used the name
      when I was playing <a href = "https://www.blankmediagames.com/"> Town of Salem </a> almost ten years ago. Now, no 
      matter whether I'm playing <a href = "https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a>, Dark Souls, or Borderlands,
      I'll go by the name Lark. </p>
    <p> I had mentioned that I was used the name Lark when writing as well. Another <em> "What do I want to be when I grow up" </em> 
      dream of mine was to be an author. There's actually a horrifically cringe-inducing picture of me in my eighth grade year book
      in which I was voted "Most Likely to be a Best-Selling Author". Interestingly enough, I have actually been rewriting the same
      novel for almost 15 years, and I'm finally getting close to a completed manuscript. As the novel itself started off as a realistic
      fiction in which I stupidly promised to write in my classmates as characters, I wanted the most distance I could put between 
      the original short story and my completed manuscript, <strong> including distance from my real name. </strong> 

    </p> As for the "crest" part of "CrestLark", I literally chose the word at random because I liked the way that it sounds.
    It turns out there's an actual type of Lark called a Crested Lark. They're sweet little birds with a crest similar to that
    of a cardinal or a blue jay. Just look at this little cutie:

  <h4>Parting Remarks</h4>  
  <p> As introductions go, I think that might be the best that I'm going to be able to muster. Keep an eye on this, because 
      as I learn, I'm going to be adding more. I'd love to add some scrolling galleries of my jewelry work, and some fun callbacks to the 
      video games that I mentioned. Needless to say, I'm aiming way higher than the <em>artistic acid trip nightmare</em> that was my New Media
      <a href = "http://existentialdeath.weebly.com/">final</a> in college.

      <p>I'd love to say something fancy like <em>All Rights Reserved</em>,
        but I didn't post any of my original art or photography, 
        so there's no intellectual property that is actually at risk.</p>
